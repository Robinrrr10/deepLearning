Tutorial 1: Introduction | Deep Learning Tutorial 1 (Tensorflow Tutorial, Keras & Python)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is intro of the video.
In this whole course we will learning about deep learning.
Its for beginner.
The pre-request for the course is, you should know the python, basics of pandas and machine learning
Here we will use tensor flow, keras and python.
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Tutorial 2: Why deep learning is becoming so popular? | Deep Learning Tutorial 2 (Tensorflow2.0, Keras & Python)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deep learning is popular and started using because of below 4 reasons

1. Data growth : 
In most of the recent years, there are more data growth (for each company or in social media or in any other). So companies wanted to use that data for further growth by processing something

2. Hardware advancement:
Olden days we have limitation in hardware to run deep learning or with huge data. Our computer don't support or takes hours of time for execution of any thing related to deep learning.
Now there are GPU's and TPU's available which we can use for deep learning or processing huge data.

3. Python and Open source ecosystem:
Previously the deep learning is done on few places. That too in C++.
Now we have python which will be easy that C++ and Java.
Also deep learning libraries become free and open source now.
Tensorflow is one of deep learning framework made by google. It is now open source
Pytorch is also one of the deep learning framework made by facebook. It is also now open source.
So now using any of these framework, things becomes easy for deep learning

4. Cloud and AI boom
Now there is cloud, which also support to run the deep learnings on the cloud machine.
Also few tech companies also annonced that many of their techs are replaced with AI.
So the AI also boom and many companies started with the AI.


All these 4 reason made the deep learning so popular.

Tutorial 3: What is a neuron? | Deep Learning Tutorial 3 (Tensorflow Tutorial, Keras & Python)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neuron is the technique where we will use two different way(steps) sequenctly to predict the right value. 
First function result will be passed to next function/equation to have the right result
Second function/equation is called activation function
Eg:
First way is the linear logistic classification, then the result and the value will be passed to sigmoid function(equation). 
So the prediction will be accurate

Eg:
First function (Eg: Linear) ----> Second function(Sigmoid) => Result

Simoid is the equation which gives any one of the two result. 0 or 1.
If result is greater than 0.5, it will be 1
If result is less than 0.5, it will be 0

Lets take an example of insurance data which has two columns 1. age and 2. hasInsurance
Here if we plot that in scatter plot chat with age on x axis and has insurance on y axis.
This will show that nearly before 42 they dont have insurace, post 42 they have the insurance
We can use linear logistic regression to draw a line which split whether person has insurace or not.
Regarding linear logistic regression, we can refer our machine learning tutorial 8 and 9 (https://github.com/Robinrrr10/machineLearning/tree/main/tutorial8_logistic_regression_or_classification, https://github.com/Robinrrr10/machineLearning/tree/main/tutorial8_part_2_logistic_regression_and_multiclass_classification_with_example_of_number_image_prediction)
By using that line we can differentiate.
But lets say the data point has few data where more aged person has the insurance.
In that case, the line might go little bad and move towards 45 age as the split and the it might miss to predict the correct one.
When missed, even for age 43, 44 it will predict they don't have insurance which is wrong.
This is the problem with linear regression (straight line).
Then to solve this, with that value, we are drawing the curved line kind of the S
Which split these two in better way.
That curved approach is called sigmoid o logit function. 
There is a equation for this.
This uses the result of previous linear result into this the sigmoid to make that better.

Below is the formula for sigmoid

Formula
z = sigmoid(y)
sigmoid(y) = 1/1+e^-y                     //Here e is Euler's number ~ 2.71828
z =  1/1+e^-y

Example:
sigmoid(200) = 1/1+2.71^-200           => Almost close to 1

sigmoid(-200) = 1/1+2.71^200           => Almost close to 0

sigmoid will give the result in the range of 0 to 1.
If it is close to 0, we need to go with 0
If it is close to 1, we need to go with 1
Here 0.5 splits whether it is close to 0 or close to 1

Here we have 2 steps.
In first step, we are still drawing with linear equaltion
y = mx + b         //x is age

In second step, we are using y which we got from previous step in sigmoid equation below
z = 1/1+e^-y        //z is is person will buy insurance

In first step we are using linear logistics classification and drawing straight line and finding y.
In second step, we are using the y on sigmoid formula and finding the z whether the person will buy insurance or not


Lets say from the linear logistics regression we are getting below. We can get value via model.coef_ and model.intercept_

y = 0.042 * x + 1.53   //x is age,   0.042 is the m (model.coef_) and 1.53 is the b (model.intercept_) //This same we get from ml tutorial 8 of the video

Here when x age is passed, it will give y and that y will be given on below sigmoid formula

z = 1/1+e^-y               //e is 2.71 constant. y we get from above

And we will get z

as per example if age 35 is passed we will get 0.48 which is less than 0.5, so near to 0. So person wont buy insurance

as per example if age 43 is passed we will get 0.57 which is more than 0.5, so near to 1. So person will buy insurance

In this case step 1 and step 2 are involed for logistics regression. This is neuron
So here first it will use linear mode(linear logistics regression) and then the value is passed to activate function (sigmoid) this is neuron
