Tutorial 9: Derivatives | Deep Learning Tutorial 9 (Tensorflow Tutorial, Keras & Python)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here we can see what is derivatives and partial derivatives.
This is important because based on this the error and back propagation works in neural network
Here we can see slope and derivatives.

Please refer image and check below
Slope is the difference of y and x in straight line
Slope = Δy/Δx   = difference in y / difference in x
if y changes() to 3 and x changes to 1 between each point
Then slope  = 3 / 1
Slope y = 3

Please refer image and check below
When line is non linear / not straight, it looks like little curve, how to find the slope.
Here the slope is not constant. Based on what point we are looking into, the slope might vary
To find this slope, we need to zoom in and it might look a little straight line.
Here we need to take very small two points
If f(x) = x2 and we can calculate f(x + Δx) 
Find derivatives
We know that f(x + Δx) = (x + Δx)^2
We know that (x + Δx)^2: f(x + Δx) = x^2 + 2xΔx + (Δx)^2

Slope formula is = f(x + Δx)-f(x) / Δx
=  x^2+2xΔx+(Δx)^2-x^2 / Δx
= 2xΔx+(Δx)^2 / Δx                            //cancelled x^2 and -x^2
=  2x+Δx                 //divided each by Δx
Δx   = 2x
Derivatives od x^2 is 2X    //2 will go at start and power - 1 where x^2 = 2x1x^2-1 = 2X
Derviatives answer will be functions. Here answer is 2x
Derivatives will be in non linear or little curve lines

Below are the derivatives of few 

d / dx x^3 = 3x^2
d / dx 7x^3 = 21x^2
d / dx 2x^3 + x^5= 6x^2 + 5x^4

Derivatives will be always a function


Slope vs Derivatives
Slope is used for linear equation
Derivatives is used for non linear equation

Slope is a constant
Derivatives is the function


Now we can see partial derivatives.

f(x,y) = x^3 + y^2
df / dx = x^3 + 0 = 3x^2          //We are making the y as 0 here
df / dy = 0 + y^2 = 2y            //We are making the x as 0 here

How the derivatives useful in neural network.
This gives huch the result changes based on input changes

For example,
Lets say we have number of betrooms and squarefeet to predict price.

f(bedrooms, sqfts) = betrooms^3 + sqfts^2
d(price) / d(betrooms) = 3betrooms^2  //This will give how much the price changes based on betrooms
d(proce) / d(sqfts) = 2sqfts       //This gives how much the price changes based on sqfts


Lets take one example where it has age and afforability which gives whether person buy insurance or not
Based on this training during each time, it will adjust its weight or formula.
Based on change in age, it will change the score/predict whether the person will buy insurance or not
Based on change in afforability, it will change the score/predict whether the person will buy insurance or not
Based on both age and afforability changes, it will predict how much whether the person will buy insurance or not. This is partial derivatives


Adding result of exercise here as this is maths related. not the code:

Below are Functions. Find derivatives

2x^4 - 7y^20 + z + 5
=8x^3 - 140y^19 + z^0  //Removed 5 as there is no x or y or z
=8x^3 - 140y^19 + 1

x^-3 + 2y^1
= -3x^-4 + 2y^0
= -3x^-4 + 2   //y =1, so 2 x 1 = 2

cos(x)sin(x)
Correct answer is cos^2(x)-sin^2(x)

(x + 5)(x - 2)
=x^2 - 2x + 5x - 10
=x^2 + 3x - 10
=2x + 3x^0 - 10  
=2x + 3   //Remove 10 as there is no x and x^0 is 1. So 3 x 1 is 3


7
=0   //Removed 7 as it don't have x or function into it

9x
=9x^0
=9     //x^0 is 1. 1 x 9 is 9
