Tutorial 5 : Install tensorflow 2.0 | Deep Learning Tutorial 5 (Tensorflow Tutorial, Keras & Python)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this tutorial we can see how we can install tensorflow

Make sure you have only one version of python installed on our machine
If you are install anconda, it will install python first and then it will install anconda.
If there is already a python, then there might be 2 version of python.
This can create a problem.
So better make sure only one python version is installed on your machine
We can go into control panel -> program and features
There we can search for python.

Open terminal or command prompt.
Below is the command to install tensorflow
pip install tensorflow

//This should install tensor flow.

Now if you give below line on jupyter notebook or in python file, we should not get the error
import tensoflow
