Tutorial 6: Pytorch vs Tensorflow vs Keras | Deep Learning Tutorial 6 (Tensorflow Tutorial, Keras & Python)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tensorflow is one of the deep learning framework created by google
Pytorch is other deep learning framework created by facebook
There is one more deep learning frameworkf called CNTK which was created by microsoft. That is not much popular or used like above two.

Keras is not the full fledged deep learning framework.
This is wrapper which internally calls deep learning frameworks like tensorflow, CNTK and Theano

The reason why keras comes is, using tensorflow directly was little code complex.
keras made that simple to use. 

Previously keras will be installed using pip install keras. And the tensorflow will be imported via backend.
Now in tensorflow 2.0 they have included the keras, so we can directly use by calling from tensor import keras.
