Tutorial 4 : Neural Network Simply Explained | Deep Learning Tutorial 4 (Tensorflow2.0, Keras & Python)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lets talk this with the example to understand neural network
Let say we wanted to build the approach to predict whether the image is koala or not. (Koala is the animal in australia)

To make this happen, we can give split task for each person
Person 1 can take care of eyes
Person 2 can take care of nose
Person 3 can take care of Ears

Person 4 can take care of front legs
Person 5 can take care of back legs

Each persons are assigned with their given parts and we are giving more photos to train on that specific parts.
Once we give the photo to predict, each one will comes up with the score
There is as score of 0 to 1
Which has 0, 0.5 and 1
0 means no, 0.5 not sure. may be. 1 means yes

Person 1, person 2 and person 3 will report the score to Person A (Person A takes care of Face) - There is weightage given for each parts as per importance: Eg: Face = eye * 0.2 + nose * 0.5 + ears * 0.3

Person 4 and person 5 will report the score to Person B (Person B takes care of body) - There is weightage given for this as well: Eg: Body = front leg * 0.5 + back leg * 0.5

Person A and Person B reports to Person C (Person C takes care of final result). There is a weightage here as well Eg: Full koala = face * 0.6 + body * 0.4

Now Person C will give the final score to predict whether it is Koala or not.

This is simple example of neural network.

Here in Neural network it has 3 layers
1. Input layer (Here Person 1, Person 2, Peson 3, Person 4 and Person 5 are input layers)
2. Hidden layer (Person A and Person B are hidden layers)
3. Output layer (Person C is the output layer)


During training, there are changes it might miss predict. During that time, the answer will be given back to correct by themself.
That is Backward error propagation


In neural network there is one set of input layers, there can be multiple set of hidden layers and there is only one output layer

This is neural network
