Tutorial 3: What is a neuron? | Deep Learning Tutorial 3 (Tensorflow Tutorial, Keras & Python)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neuron is the technique where we will use two different way(steps) sequenctly to predict the right value. 
First function result will be passed to next function/equation to have the right result
Second function/equation is called activation function
Eg:
First way is the linear logistic classification, then the result and the value will be passed to sigmoid function(equation). 
So the prediction will be accurate

Eg:
First function (Eg: Linear) ----> Second function(Sigmoid) => Result

Simoid is the equation which gives any one of the two result. 0 or 1.
If result is greater than 0.5, it will be 1
If result is less than 0.5, it will be 0

Lets take an example of insurance data which has two columns 1. age and 2. hasInsurance
Here if we plot that in scatter plot chat with age on x axis and has insurance on y axis.
This will show that nearly before 42 they dont have insurace, post 42 they have the insurance
We can use linear logistic regression to draw a line which split whether person has insurace or not.
Regarding linear logistic regression, we can refer our machine learning tutorial 8 and 9 (https://github.com/Robinrrr10/machineLearning/tree/main/tutorial8_logistic_regression_or_classification, https://github.com/Robinrrr10/machineLearning/tree/main/tutorial8_part_2_logistic_regression_and_multiclass_classification_with_example_of_number_image_prediction)
By using that line we can differentiate.
But lets say the data point has few data where more aged person has the insurance.
In that case, the line might go little bad and move towards 45 age as the split and the it might miss to predict the correct one.
When missed, even for age 43, 44 it will predict they don't have insurance which is wrong.
This is the problem with linear regression (straight line).
Then to solve this, with that value, we are drawing the curved line kind of the S
Which split these two in better way.
That curved approach is called sigmoid o logit function. 
There is a equation for this.
This uses the result of previous linear result into this the sigmoid to make that better.

Below is the formula for sigmoid

Formula
z = sigmoid(y)
sigmoid(y) = 1/1+e^-y                     //Here e is Euler's number ~ 2.71828
z =  1/1+e^-y

Example:
sigmoid(200) = 1/1+2.71^-200           => Almost close to 1

sigmoid(-200) = 1/1+2.71^200           => Almost close to 0

sigmoid will give the result in the range of 0 to 1.
If it is close to 0, we need to go with 0
If it is close to 1, we need to go with 1
Here 0.5 splits whether it is close to 0 or close to 1

Here we have 2 steps.
In first step, we are still drawing with linear equaltion
y = mx + b         //x is age

In second step, we are using y which we got from previous step in sigmoid equation below
z = 1/1+e^-y        //z is is person will buy insurance

In first step we are using linear logistics classification and drawing straight line and finding y.
In second step, we are using the y on sigmoid formula and finding the z whether the person will buy insurance or not


Lets say from the linear logistics regression we are getting below. We can get value via model.coef_ and model.intercept_

y = 0.042 * x + 1.53   //x is age,   0.042 is the m (model.coef_) and 1.53 is the b (model.intercept_) //This same we get from ml tutorial 8 of the video

Here when x age is passed, it will give y and that y will be given on below sigmoid formula

z = 1/1+e^-y               //e is 2.71 constant. y we get from above

And we will get z

as per example if age 35 is passed we will get 0.48 which is less than 0.5, so near to 0. So person wont buy insurance

as per example if age 43 is passed we will get 0.57 which is more than 0.5, so near to 1. So person will buy insurance

In this case step 1 and step 2 are involed for logistics regression. This is neuron
So here first it will use linear mode(linear logistics regression) and then the value is passed to activate function (sigmoid) this is neuron



In above example, we have taken only one feature which is the age, for this above is the equation
y = 0.042 * x + 1.53   //x is age,

There can be multiple features for the prediction, in that case, we need to use below formula

y = 0.042 * X1 +  0.008 * X2 +  0.2 * X3 + 1.53  //where X1 is age, X2 is income, X3 is education

y = W1 * X1 +  W2 * X2 +  W3 * X3 + b   //Equation

y = nEn=1 W^iX^i + b  //Please refer image for correct equation. We cannot able to write in notes. That is the final equation



So here, with age there can w1 value, with income there can be w2 value and with education there can be w3 value.
With that equation we will get the y.
That y is passed on the sigmoid function to get the result. This is the neuron when there are more features.

In first step, with all feature it will find the y
And then in second step, with y it will find the z on below fomula
z = 1/1+e^-y
z will be between 0 and 1.
This is neuron
